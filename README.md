# Maximum Independent Set Algorithm

  An undirected graph G = (V, E) is a pair of finite sets, where the set V contains the vertices of the graph and the set E contains its distinct unordered edges. Two vertices of a graph are considered adjacent (connected by an edge) if an edge exits between them. An Independent Set (I) is a subset of vertices in G such that no two vertices in I are adjacent. The Maximum Independent Set (MIS) of G is an I with maximum cardinality among all I sets of G. The MIS problem is to find an I with the largest number of vertices in a given G.
